# Manu-s-Basic-Computer-using-verilog-HDL

This is the project of the course EE445 Computer Architecture. Proffessor Manu's basic computer has been programmed using Proffessor Manu's textbook and verilog HDL as programming language. Cocotb and Icarus Verilog is used for simulation purposes. Inside of the memory, there are some ARM Assembly codes are embedded so when you simulate it, those codes are being executed. In order to add new codes, binary representations of ARM Assembly codes must be written on the memory.
